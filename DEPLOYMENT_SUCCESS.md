# 🎉 DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - Final Status

## ✅ What's Working

Your PDF to Flowchart Generator is **successfully deployed** on Streamlit Cloud at:
**https://flowchart-automation.streamlit.app/**

The app includes:
- ✅ PDF upload and text extraction
- ✅ AI-powered flowchart generation using Groq
- ✅ Multiple output formats (steps, description, Mermaid code)
- ✅ Live visualization links
- ✅ Robust error handling and encoding fixes
- ✅ API key validation and debugging tools

## 🔧 Current Issue: API Key Encoding Error

The app is deployed but failing with: `'ascii' codec can't encode character '\u0417'`

**Root Cause**: Your Groq API key contains non-ASCII characters (Cyrillic letters), which indicates it was corrupted during copy/paste.

## 🚀 How to Fix (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Get a Clean API Key
1. Go to [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys)
2. **Create a NEW API key** (don't reuse the old one)
3. Copy it carefully (should start with `gsk_` and be only letters/numbers)

### Step 2: Update Streamlit Secrets
1. Go to your [Streamlit Cloud dashboard](https://share.streamlit.io/)
2. Find your app "flowchart-automation"
3. Click the ⚙️ settings icon
4. Go to **Secrets** tab
5. Replace the `GROQ_API_KEY` value with your new clean key
6. Save changes

### Step 3: Verify
1. Wait ~30 seconds for redeployment
2. Refresh your app
3. You should see "✅ Groq API key is valid and working!"
4. Upload a PDF and test the flowchart generation

## 🛠️ Debugging Tools Available

If you still have issues, the app now includes:
- **Debug section** at the top to analyze your API key
- **Detailed error messages** showing exactly what's wrong
- **Character-by-character analysis** of the API key
